# Up4It - Spontaneous Friend Finder (Mobile App)

## Overview
Up4It is a mobile application that helps users find and connect with new friends in their area through spontaneous activities. Unlike traditional social apps that require extensive planning, Up4It focuses on immediate connections for users who are available "right now." The app combines the spontaneity of the original web concept with the addictive swiping mechanics of dating apps like Tinder, but reimagined for platonic connections.

## Core Features

### 1. Swipe-Based Friend Discovery
- Users can swipe through potential friends based on shared interests and proximity
- Each profile showcases personality traits, interests, and current availability
- Algorithm matches users who are likely to form meaningful friendships
- Filters allow users to find people interested in specific activities (sports, dining, studying, etc.)

### 2. Activity-Based Matching
- Users indicate what they're "up for" right now (coffee, study session, walk in the park, etc.)
- Time-limited activities (4-hour window) create urgency and spontaneity
- Location-based matching prioritizes people who are physically close
- Activity cards show what, where, and when with visual appeal

### 3. In-Person Verification
- Unique word-pair codes generated for each meetup
- Both parties verify they've met by confirming the same code
- Builds trust in the platform and confirms actual meetings happened
- Incentivizes real-world connections over endless chatting

### 4. Friend Profiles
- Simple profile creation with university email verification (@student.ubc.ca, @alumni.ubc.ca)
- Photo gallery with moderation to ensure appropriate content
- Interest tags that help the matching algorithm
- Brief bio focusing on personality and friendship style
- Activity history showing past meetups and connections

### 5. Real-time Messaging
- Chat opens after both users express interest in connecting
- Automatically suggests meeting points based on both users' locations
- Context-aware message templates to overcome awkward conversation starts
- Disappearing chats if no meetup occurs within the time window
